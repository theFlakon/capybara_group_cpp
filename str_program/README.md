**str_program** is an **educational console application written in C++**.  
The project demonstrates basic string and data processing algorithms, modular program structure, and multi-mode execution using CMake.

The application supports **four independent modes**, each implemented as a separate module.

## Features / Modes

1. **Compressor**  
   Compresses input data using a simple educational compression algorithm.  
   The implementation is intended for learning purposes and not for production use.

2. **Decompressor**  
   Restores the original data from the compressed format produced by the compressor mode.

3. **Caesar Cipher (Encryption)**  
   Encrypts text using the classical Caesar cipher algorithm by shifting characters by a fixed number of positions.

4. **Caesar Cipher (Decryption)**  
   Decrypts text that was encrypted using the Caesar cipher and restores the original message.
